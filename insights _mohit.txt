1️⃣ Which zones are energy hotspots or inefficient?

Central Zone is the primary energy hotspot, showing the highest total kWh consumption.

This is expected due to a higher concentration of commercial and industrial consumers.

North Zone shows signs of energy inefficiency, combining moderate consumption with higher outage minutes.

✅ Conclusion:

Hotspot: Central Zone

Inefficient Zone: North Zone

2️⃣ What consumer type uses the most power?

Industrial consumers consume the highest total energy.

They have:

High daily consumption

Higher peak usage values

Residential consumers consume the least energy overall.

✅ Ranking (Highest → Lowest):

Industrial

Commercial

Residential

3️⃣ Are certain times/days correlated with high peak usage?

Weekdays show higher average peak usage compared to weekends.

This aligns with:

Industrial operations

Office/commercial activity during business days

✅ Conclusion:
Peak usage is strongly correlated with weekdays, not weekends.

4️⃣ Are there areas with unreliable power supply (frequent outages)?

North Zone records the highest total outage minutes.

Faulty meters are more frequent in this zone.

Indicates:

Aging infrastructure

Maintenance issues

✅ Conclusion:
North Zone has the most unreliable power supply.
